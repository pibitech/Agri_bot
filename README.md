Agriculture Chatbot using RAG
*Project Overview*
This project aims to develop an OpenAI-powered chatbot designed to assist farmers with regenerative agriculture practices. Utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the chatbot will provide accurate and contextually relevant information to farmers.

*Current Status*
We are currently in the process of collecting datasets and integrating into the RAG system. This repository contains the prototype link, requirements.txt file, and app.py file with the RAG code.
